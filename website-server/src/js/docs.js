        <h2> What's this website for? </h2>
        <p>
            Do you have the experience that you are in low mood, but you find it hard to tell it to your family or friends? Well, welcome to <b>Message Bottles</b>, a safe space for sharing your thoughts and emotions <i>anonymously</i>. <br/><br/> Here, you can freely express the feelings and struggles that are hard to voice elsewhere. Your words will drift like a message in a bottle, to be randomly discovered and responded to by others. <br/><br/> Together, let's support each other through life's ups and downs!

        <h4> For Developers </h4>
        <p>
            Until now, this website is just built by myself, who just began to learn web development (and the <a href="https://react.dev" >React</a> package) for less than a week. Clearly, the website is far from perfect now. Thus, if you are interested, feel free to contribute to the project <a href="https://github.com/Hidden-Hyperparameter/message-website">Here</a>!
