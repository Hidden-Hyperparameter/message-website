## What's this website for?

Do you have the experience that you are in low mood, but you find it hard to tell it to your family or friends? Well, welcome to **Message Bottles**, a safe space for sharing your thoughts and emotions *anonymously*.

Here, you can freely express the feelings and struggles that are hard to voice elsewhere. Your words will drift like a message in a bottle, to be randomly discovered and responded to by others.

Together, let's support each other through life's ups and downs!

## For Developers

This website is just built by myself, who just began to learn web development (and the React package) for less than a week. Clearly, the website is far from perfect now. Thus, if you are interested, feel free to contribute to the project Here!
